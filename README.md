# Simple To-Do List Application

This project is a simple to-do list application built using React and Vite. It provides users with an intuitive way to manage tasks with a clean and modern interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Build tool for fast development and bundling.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
